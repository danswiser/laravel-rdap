RDAP is a protocol to query domain registration data. It is seen as the successor to WHOIS. The main advantage over WHOIS is that the returned data is standardized and structured as JSON. A downside of RDAP is that, at the moment of writing, not all TLDs are supported.

This package contains a few classes to query basic data from RDAP. It also provides caching of the responses out of the box.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-rdap
```


You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="rdap-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php

use Carbon\CarbonInterval;

return [
    /*
     * When making an RDAP query, we first have got to make a request to determine
     *  the server responsible for the tld of the query. Here you can specify
     * how long we should cache the server URLs.
     */

    'tld_servers_cache' => [
        'store_name' => null,
        'duration_in_seconds' => CarbonInterval::week()->totalSeconds,
    ],

    /*
     * RDAP seem to be a bit unreliable when responding to domain queries. 
     * We solve this by attempting a request to RDAP a couple of times 
     * until we get a response.
     */
    'domain_queries' => [
        /*
         * How long we should wait per attempt to get a response
         */
        'timeout_in_seconds' => 5,
        /*
         * How many times we should attempt getting a response
         */
        'retry_times' => 3,
        /*
         * The time between attempts
         */
        'sleep_in_milliseconds_between_retries' => 1000,
    ],
];
```

## Usage


## Perform a domain query

To get information about a domain, call `domain()`.

```php
use Spatie\Rdap\Facades\Rdap;

$domain = Rdap::domain('google.com'); // returns an instance of `Spatie\Rdap\Responses\DomainResponse`
```

If you pass a non-existing domain, then the `domain()` function will return `null`.

### Retrying requests

RDAP seem to be a bit unreliable when responding to domain requests.  We solve this by attempting a request to RDAP a couple of times  until we get a response. In the `rdap` config file, you can set the defaults for the retry mechanism. 

You can override those defaults, by passing extra parameters to `domain`.

```php
$domain = Rdap::domain(
   'google.com'
   timeoutInSecons: 10,
   retryTimes: 4,
   sleepInMillisecondsBetweenRetries: 2000,       
);
````

### Get various dates

On an instance of `DomainResponse` you can call various methods to fetch various dates. All of these methods return an instance of `Carbon\Carbon`.

```
$domain->registrationDate();
$domain->expirationDate();
$domain->lastChangedDate();
$domain->lastUpdateOfRdapDb();
```

### Getting all domain properties

You can get all properties of a `DomainResponse` using `all()`.

```php
$properties = $domain->all(); // returns an array
```

To know which properties get returned, take a look at [this json containing the response for google.com](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-rdap/blob/b37a323a2743d7ae21c397367446160900aad517/tests/TestSupport/stubs/google-domain.json).

### Getting a specific domain property

Use `get()` to get a specific domain property.

```php
$domain->get('objectClassName'); // returns 'domain'
```

You can use dot notation to reach deeper in the properties.

```php
$domain->get('links.0.value'); // returns 'https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/domain/GOOGLE.COM'
```

### Check if a domain as a specific status

You can check if a domain has a specific status, such as "client transfer prohibited", using the `hasStatus` method.

```php
use Spatie\Rdap\Enums\DomainStatus;

$domain->hasStatus(DomainStatus::ClientTransferProhibited); // returns a boolean
```

### Check if domain is supported by Rdap

You can check if Rdap has info about your domain using `domainIsSupported`

```php
use Spatie\Rdap\Facades\Rdap;

Rdap::domainIsSupported('freek.dev'); // returns true;
Rdap::domainIsSupported('spatie.be'); // returns false because 'be' isn't currently a supported tld;
```

```php
use Spatie\Rdap\Facades\Rdap;

$domain = Rdap::domain('google.com'); // returns an instance of `Spatie\Rdap\Responses\DomainResponse`
```

If you pass a non-existing domain, then the `domain()` function will return `null`.

## Handling timeouts

Sometimes RDAP is slow in responding. If a response isn't returned in a timely manner, a `Spatie\Rdap\Exceptions\RdapRequestTimedOut` exception will be thrown.

## Working with RDAP DNS

For each TLD a specific server is used to respond to domain queries. Such a server is called a "DNS server". The official list of all RDAP DNS server is available as JSON [here](https://data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json).

The `Spatie\Rdap\RdapDns` class can fetch information from that JSON file. Because all above domain methods need to search the approriate DNS server, we cache the list with available DNS servers. By default, the response will be cached for a week. You can configure this caching period in the `rdap` config file.

You can get info on Rdap DNS via this `dns` function.

```php
$rdapDns = Spatie\Rdap\Facades\Rdap::dns();
```

### Get the DNS server URL

To get the DNS server URL for a specific domain call  `getServerForDomain`:

```php
$rdapDns->getServerForDomain('google.com'); // returns "https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/"
```

Alternatively, you can use `getServerForTld` and pass a TLD.

```php
$rdapDns->getServerForTld('com'); // returns "https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/"
```

If you pass a domain or tld that is not supported, the above methods will return `null`.

### Get all supported TLDs

To get a list of all supported TLDs, call `supportedTlds`.

```php
$rdapDns->supportedTlds(); // returns an array with all supported TLDs
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
